        Erik Petterson Sjöqvist and Elie Sandberg met one another in the sixth
        grade, when the both attended a special music school in Gothenburg,
        Sweden. Jimmy Petterson, Erik’s dad, has worked with music on and off
        since the 1970s. When the boys were about to graduate from high school,
        Jimmy suggested that they should travel around Europe during the summer,
        and attempt to survive on what they could earn with their music. They
        called themselves “Father & Son + 1,” produced a CD before departing,
        filled Jimmy’s Ford Explorer to the brim with music and sports
        equipment, and headed off in search of adventure. Jimmy organized about
        20 gigs in restaurants and bars prior to their departure, and the rest
        of the time, they planned to busk the streets of Europe. They played
        their street music in Helsinki, Tallinn, Riga, Vienna, Ljubljana,
        Venice, and many other locations. Ultimately, that first tour saw the
        trio perform in ten countries. They had a lot of fun, and even came home
        with some money in their pockets. That was the summer of 2009. Since
        then, ten years has quickly passed, and a lot has happened. Elie became
        a father in 2017 and left the band to assume his responsibility as a
        parent, but despite that loss, the band has grown from three to five
        members. Simon Grahn has added his saxophone, flute, and voice to the
        mix, while bass player, Viktor Lenberg, and drummer, Mickel Löfvenius,
        have also become permanent members of the band, which today is called
        the Father & Son Band. They play an interesting combination of old rock
        ‘n’ roll, pop, country, blues, American folk music spiced usually with a
        few of their own compositions. They do many of the songs in three-part
        harmony and specialize in music of the ’50s, ’60s, and ’70s. Often, they
        perform a show called “The History of Rock ‘n’ Roll.” That show includes
        hits from many of the icons of rock music, including Elvis, Chuck Berry,
        the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, Creedence Clearwater Revival, Jimi
        Hendrix, Sam Cooke, Johnny Cash, Simon & Garfunkel, Bob Dylan, the
        Beachboys, the Everly Brothers, Bruce Springsteen, and many more. They
        dress up in typical ’50s garb for the first half of the show, and
        following a short intermission, they return on stage in classic clothing
        of the flower-power years. All in all, the Father & Son Band invites
        their public to an unforgettable evening of nostalgia.

The Father & Son Band really began as a gentle evening tradition of a
father singing his son to sleep. At age four, Erik, the son, first
helped dad, Jimmy, on stage, singing Old McDonald into a microphone
while his dad played guitar at the Spielberghaus in Saalbach. Fast
forward a few decades to the present day, and Jimmy and Erik Petterson
have added saxophonist, Simon Grahn, bass player, Viktor Lenberg,
drummer, Mickel Löfvenius, to create a full band. Jimmy and Erik have
both written some of their own music in a country-rock vein, but the
band generally plays a variety of well-known covers from the 1950s,
1960s, and 1970s.
