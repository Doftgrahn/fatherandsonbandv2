                        Fast forward a dozen years, and Erik’s close friend,
                        Elie Sandberg, joined father and son on a trip to
                        Austria. While enjoying hikes around the Salzkammergut,
                        the three worked on harmonies, and Jimmy organized a few
                        gigs in local restaurants. Each summer, the number of
                        gigs seemed to increase, and slowly, so did the band
                        members.

                    <p>
                        Another friend from school, Simon Grahn joined the band
                        with his saxophone, flute, clarinet, and harmonica. And
                        eventually Viktor Lenberg added his bass and Mickel
                        Löwenius brought his drums into the group.

                    <p>
                        Currently, Elie is not traveling with the band, as he
                        has commitments with his baby son, so the band is
                        comprised of the remaining five members.
                        <br /> With a mixture of rock ’n' roll, country, blues,
                        evergreens, and original compositions, we always strive
                        to have as much fun on stage as we possibly can! And we
                        live for the music!{" "}
