        The Father & Son Band really began as a gentle evening tradition of a
        father singing his son to sleep. At age four, Erik, the son, first
        helped dad, Jimmy, on stage, singing Old McDonald into a microphone
        while his dad played guitar at the Spielberghaus in Saalbach. Fast
        forward a few decades to the present day, and Jimmy and Erik Petterson
        have added saxophonist, Simon Grahn, bass player, Viktor Lenberg,
        drummer, Mickel LÃ¶fvenius, to create a full band. Jimmy and Erik have
        both written some of their own music in a country-rock vein, but the
        band generally plays a variety of well-known covers from the 1950s,
        1960s, and 1970s.
